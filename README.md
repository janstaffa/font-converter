# font-converter
This is a little 10min project. Nothing special. But it helps a lot! Trust me.
I was basically working on a web app, and I had to create a font selector. But since I was using the HTML select, it would take me soo much time to write every single font by hand(there are around 60). So I made a very simple python script to do it for me!

The file convert.py contains the script.
And the fonts.txt contains all the fonts that I wanted to include.
